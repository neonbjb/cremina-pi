* Micro SD Card
  * 4GB minimum, 8GB Class 10 recommended
  * $7 - http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Class-Adapter-MB-MP16DA-AM/dp/B00IVPU7KE
* Solid State Relay - For switching on and off the heating element
  * $10 - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13015
* Thermocouple Amplifier - For interfacing between the Raspberry Pi and Thermocouple temperature probe
  * $15 - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13266
  * MAX6675 Thermocouple amps can be supported, but you will need to modify the Adafruit31855 library.
* Type K Thermocouple - For accurate temperature measurement
  * $15 - http://www.auberins.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=20_3&products_id=307
* Ribbon Cable - For connecting everything together
  * $7 - http://www.amazon.com/Veewon-Flexible-Multicolored-Female-Breadboard/dp/B00N7XX4XM
    * Female to Female if using the Raspberry Pi 2
  * $5 - http://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Width-Colorful-Flexible-Ribbon/dp/B00BWFY6JI
    * Bare wire if using the Raspberry Pi Zero
* 14 gauge wire - For connecting the A/C side of the relay to the circuit
  * $5 - Hardware Store / Scrap
    * Don't skimp here.  Remember this wire will be in close proximit to a ~240*F boiler

#### Circuit Diagram
High-level circuit diagram:

![Circuit Diagram](media/circuit.png?raw=true "Circuit Diagram")

NOTE: This custom version of silvia-pi requires that you connect the SSR in reverse!
e.g. Connect the Raspberry Pi 5V line to the SSR (+) and pin BCM7 to SSR (-).

#### Software
* OS - Raspbian Jessie
  * Full - https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest
  * Lite (for smaller SD Cards) - https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest

Install Raspbian and configure Wi-Fi and timezone.

#### silvia-pi Software Installation Instructions
Execute on the pi bash shell:
````
sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade
sudo apt-get -y install rpi-update git build-essential python-dev python-smbus python-pip
sudo rpi-update
sudo bash -c 'echo "dtparam=spi=on" >> /boot/config.txt'
sudo reboot
````

After the reboot:
````
sudo git clone https://github.com/brycesub/silvia-pi.git /root/silvia-pi
sudo /root/silvia-pi/setup.sh
````
This last step will download the necessariy python libraries and install the silvia-pi software in /root/silvia-pi

It also creates an entry in /etc/rc.local to start the software on every boot.

#### API Documentation

##### GET /allstats
Returns JSON of all the following statistics:
* i : Current loop iterator value (increases 10x per second)
* tempf : Temperature in °F
* avgtemp : Average temperature over the last 10 cycles (1 second) in °F
* settemp : Current set (goal) temperature in °F
* iscold : True if the temp was <120°F in the last 15 minutes
* hestat : 0 if heating element is currently off, 1 if heating element is currently on
* pidval : PID output from the last cycle
* avgpid : Average PID output over the last 10 cycles (1 second)
* pterm : PID P Term value (Proportional error)
* iterm : PID I Term value (Integral error)
* dterm : PID D Term value (Derivative error)
* snooze : Current or last snooze time, a string in the format HH:MM (24 hour)
* snoozeon : true if machine is currently snoozing, false if machine is not snoozing

##### GET /curtemp
Returns string of the current temperature in °F

##### GET /settemp
Returns string of the current set (goal) temperature in °F

##### POST /settemp
Expects one input 'settemp' with a value between 200-260.  
Sets the set (goal) temperature in °F
Returns the set temp back or a 400 error if unsuccessful.

##### GET /snooze
Returns string of the current or last snooze time formatted "HH:MM" (24 hour).  
e.g. 13:00 if snoozing until 1:00 PM local time.

##### POST /snooze
Expects one input 'snooze', a string in the format "HH:MM" (24 hour).  
This enables the snooze function, the machine will sleep until the time specified.  
Returns the snooze time set or 400 if passed an invalid input.

##### POST /resetsnooze
Disables/cancels the current snooze functionality.  
Returns true always.

##### GET /restart
Issues a reboot command to the Raspberry Pi.

##### GET /healthcheck
A simple healthcheck to see if the webserver thread is repsonding.  
Returns string 'OK'.
